A terminal-based password quiz to memorize your passwords.

## Important disclaimer

> The intended purpose of this program is only to memorize master passwords, such as the passwords to your password
> manager or encryption passwords. Memorizing all your passwords is improper password management, as it encourages bad
> practices such as re-using passwords and using weaker passwords. For passwords other than your master passwords, please
> follow the following guidelines:
> - use a password manager
> - use unique, strong passwords
> - use two-factor authentication (2FA) as a second line of defense
